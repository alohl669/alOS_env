# Keyboard Shortcuts

## A look at our new environment
This document will be used as a reference guide because we are at the heart of the reason for this working environment, the keyboard shortcuts. The idea is based on the premise that the less you use the mouse, the more efficient your work with the machine will be in the long run. This idea is something difficult to assimilate and that is why this environment is installed as an alternative to mate and does not replace it in the first place.
